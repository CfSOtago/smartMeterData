# Intro

We have some Tongan smart meter data provided as part of [Kakau Foliaki](https://www.otago.ac.nz/centre-sustainability/staff/otago678543.html)'s PhD. This code loads & tests it.

# Initial dataset - file: CRF_2020_1_28_4296268_1 - Copy.7z

Sent to KF. No meta-data. Sent as xml. Converted (possibly with errors) to .csv.

In theory this should be half-hourly electricity consumption (Wh or kWh) data for a large(ish) number of Tongan households. It even be all Tongan households with smart meters. But who knows...

What have we got?

```{r setData_f1}
f1_xml <- paste0(dPathFull, "/CRF_2020_1_28_4296268_1 - Copy.xml")
f1_csv <- paste0(dPathFull, "/Smartmeter.csv")
```

First try loading the (huge) xml file (`r f1_xml`)

```{r load_f1_xml}
try(f1_df <- XML::xmlToDataFrame(f1_xml)) # try as it breaks if there's an error

```

Helpful.

Now try loading the .csv file (`r f1_csv`) and test what we get before any processing.

```{r load_f1_csv}
f1_dt_orig <- data.table::fread(f1_csv, check.names = TRUE)

# names of variables
names(f1_dt_orig)

h <- head(f1_dt_orig)
kableExtra::kable(h, caption = "First few rows")
```

```{r skim_f1_dt_orig}
sk <- skimr::skim(f1_dt_orig)

print(sk)
```

So what does all that mean? Let's test some of the variables.

```{r copy_f1_csv}
f1_dt <- data.table::copy(f1_dt_orig) # so we can revert if needed
```

## StartDate 

Looks like a dateTime, does it walk like a dateTime? Looks like it's in `d/m/y H:M` form.

```{r process_f1_csv_StartDate}
f1_dt[, ba_StartDate := lubridate::dmy_hm(StartDate)]

# convert & test

head(f1_dt[, .(StartDate, ba_StartDate)])

skimr::skim(f1_dt[, .(StartDate, ba_StartDate)])
```


>So startDate is 2018-11-30 11:00:00 and is constant. Presumably this is the start date for the data extract?

## EndDate

Logic (haha) would suggest this would be the end date for the data extract. Looks like it's in `d/m/y H:M` form.

```{r process_f1_csv_EndDate}

f1_dt[, ba_EndDate := lubridate::dmy_hm(EndDate)]
dt <- f1_dt[, .(EndDate, ba_EndDate)]
head(dt)
skimr::skim(dt)
```


>And EndDate is also constant and is 2020-01-27 21:25:00 - but is not a round 'half hour'?

## EndTime

So what then is this? For a start it's in a different form - `d/m/y H:M:S`

Of course it could also be m/d/y - can't tell from these rows.

```{r process_f1_csv_EndTime}

f1_dt[, ba_EndTime := lubridate::dmy_hms(EndTime)]
dt <- f1_dt[, .(EndTime, ba_EndTime)]
head(dt)
skimr::skim(dt)
```


>So EndTime is also constant at 2019-05-12 05:00:00 but it is missing for a lot of rows.

## NumberOfReadings_1

For some reason this looks like a dateTime too - are the column headings mis-aligned?

This is definitely in `m/d/y H:M:S` form...

```{r process_f1_csv_NumberOfReadings_1}

f1_dt[, ba_NumberOfReadings.1 := lubridate::mdy_hms(NumberOfReadings.1)] #mdy?
dt <- f1_dt[, .(NumberOfReadings.1, ba_NumberOfReadings.1)]
head(dt)
skimr::skim(dt)
```


>NumberOfReadings.1 is constant at 2019-11-18 05:00:00 with a lot of missing. So what is this?

We don't seem to have an obvious half hourly dateTime field...

## X.id* variables

Let's look at the IDs.

```{r headAllIDs}
h <- head(f1_dt[, .(X.id, X.id.1, X.id.2)], 10)
kableExtra::kable(h, caption = "IDs - example rows") %>%
  kable_styling()

skimr::skim(f1_dt[, .(X.id, X.id.1, X.id.2)])
```


> So X.id and X.id1 could be true id variables. But X.id.2 seems to increase monotonically.

Unique values:

 * X.id: `r uniqueN(f1_dt$X.id)`
 * X.id.1: `r uniqueN(f1_dt$X.id.1)`
 * X.id.2: `r uniqueN(f1_dt$X.id.2)`

### X.id

```{r process_f1_csv_X_id}
# distributions
ggplot2::ggplot(f1_dt, aes(x = X.id)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

So what do we infer from that???

### X.id.1


```{r process_f1_csv_X_id_1}
# distributions
ggplot2::ggplot(f1_dt, aes(x = X.id.1)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Well that looks more like a proper id - essentially random numbers of observations

### X.id.2

```{r process_f1_csv_X_id_2}
# distributions
ggplot2::ggplot(f1_dt, aes(x = X.id.2)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

### What the ID?

A summary table:

```{r f1_id_summary}
dt <- f1_dt[, .(nObs = .N,
                min_X.id = min(X.id),
                max_X.id = max(X.id),
                min_X.id.2 = min(X.id.2),
                max_X.id.2 = max(X.id.2)
                ), keyby = .(X.id.1)]

kableExtra::kable(head(dt), caption = "First few rows of summary table by X.id.1") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

So:

 * X.id has 599 unique values but they have weird counts
 * X.id.1 has 896 and look less systematic - would we expect about this many smart meters in the sample?
 * X.id.2 has a lot more but 0 and the highest value have identically fewer counts (and they seem to match the count profiles of the other ids)
 * X.id.2 increases monotonically across the whole dataset, not within id.

I suspect that:

 * X.id.1 is actually the household id.
 * X.id.2 is an incremental half-hour counter. We can test this by looking at the lag within each of the ids.

```{r testLag_f1}
f1_dt[, lagWithinX.id := X.id.2 - shift(X.id.2), keyby = .(X.id)]

head(f1_dt[, .(X.id, X.id.2, lagWithinX.id)])

summary(f1_dt[, .(X.id, X.id.2, lagWithinX.id)])

ggplot2::ggplot(f1_dt, aes(x = lagWithinX.id)) +
  geom_histogram()

f1_dt[, lagWithinX.id.1 := X.id.2 - shift(X.id.2), keyby = .(X.id.1)]

head(f1_dt[, .(X.id.1, X.id.2, lagWithinX.id.1)])

summary(f1_dt[, .(X.id.1, X.id.2, lagWithinX.id.1)])

ggplot2::ggplot(f1_dt, aes(x = lagWithinX.id.1)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

>Yep. So we need a way to set the first dateTime within each id and then increase it by 30 minutes each row.

## Setting true dateTime

Based on our hunch...

```{r f1_makeDateTime}
f1_dt[, counter :=1]
f1_dt[, cumsum := cumsum(counter), keyby = .(X.id.1)] # add up within X.id.1
f1_dt[, dateTime := ba_StartDate] # constant
f1_dt[, dateTime := dateTime + (cumsum * 30 * 60)] # add on the number of seconds since start

f1_dt[, date := lubridate::date(dateTime)]
f1_dt[, month := lubridate::month(dateTime,
                                  label = TRUE, 
                                  abbr = TRUE)
      ]

head(f1_dt[!is.na(X.id.1), .(X.id.1, X.id.2, ba_EndDate, ba_EndTime, 
                             ba_StartDate, dateTime)])
summary(f1_dt[!is.na(X.id.1), .(X.id.1, X.id.2, ba_EndDate, ba_EndTime,
                                ba_StartDate, dateTime)])
skim(f1_dt[, .(X.id.1, X.id.2,ba_EndDate, ba_EndTime, ba_StartDate, dateTime)])
```

> Looks OK: dateTime implies we have `r uniqueN(f1_dt$dateTime)` half hours represented which implies we only have 2 months of data.

```{r f1_checkMonths}
f1_dt[, .(nObs = .N), keyby = .(month,
                                year = lubridate::year(dateTime))][order(year)]
```


> Looks like it _but_ this depends if we've coded dateTime correctly.

Let's see how many households (IDs) and observations we have over time.

```{r plot_f1_NumberOfIXDsByDate, fig.cap="Number of unique X.id by date"}
plotDT <- f1_dt[, .(nX.id = uniqueN(X.id)), keyby = .(date)]
ggplot2::ggplot(plotDT, aes(y = nX.id, x = date)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r plotf1NumberOfX1IDsByDate, fig.cap="Number of unique X.id.1 by date"}
plotDT <- f1_dt[, .(nX.id.1 = uniqueN(X.id.1)), keyby = .(date)]
ggplot2::ggplot(plotDT, aes(y = nX.id.1, x = date)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r NumberOfObsByDateTime, fig.cap="Number of obs by date"}
plotDT <- f1_dt[, .(nObs = .N), keyby = .(date)]
ggplot2::ggplot(plotDT, aes(y = nObs, x = date)) +
  geom_point()
```

Yeah. So this does suggest that X.id.2 is a household ID as it follows the pattern of the number of observations (\@ref(fig:plotf1NumberOfX1IDsByDate)).

## NumberOfReadings
What is this for?

```{r plot_f1_NumberOfReadings}
head(f1_dt$NumberOfReadings)
ggplot2::ggplot(f1_dt[,.(NumberOfReadings)], aes(x = NumberOfReadings)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

OK, so why do we have some rows with lots of readings and some with far fewer? Is this just meta-data for each id - does it tell us how many readings we have for each ID?

## Value

Value should (ideally) be consumption per half hour.

```{r plotf1value, fig.cap="Distribution of Value"}
skim(f1_dt$Value)

ggplot2::ggplot(f1_dt[,.(Value, NumberOfReadings)], aes(x = NumberOfReadings , y = Value)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot2::ggplot(f1_dt[,.(Value, NumberOfReadings)], aes(x = Value)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Well \@ref(fig:plotf1value) looks a bit odd. Why is there a sort of threshold at 250? We obviously have very few Values over 250...

Try plotting mean of Value by dateTime across all households (remember number of X.id.1s varies across time)

```{r plot_f1_valueByDate, fig.cap = "Box plot of Value by date"}

p <- ggplot2::ggplot(f1_dt, aes(x = date , y = Value, group = date)) +
  geom_boxplot()

p

```

Christmas day looks interesting. But most of the values are below 250 on every other day.

```{r plot_f1_valueMeanByDate, fig.cap = "Mean Value by date"}
plotDT <- f1_dt[, .(meanValue = mean(Value)), keyby = .(dateTime)]
  ggplot2::ggplot(plotDT, aes(x = dateTime , y = meanValue)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r plot_f1_valueByTime, fig.cap = "Value by time of day"}
f1_dt[, hms := hms::as_hms(dateTime)]
f1_dt[, month := lubridate::month(dateTime, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)]

ggplot2::ggplot(f1_dt[!is.na(month)], aes(x = hms , y = Value, group = hms)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(. ~ month)
```

```{r plotf1meanValueByTime, fig.cap = "Mean Value by time of day"}
plotDT <- f1_dt[!is.na(month), .(meanValue = mean(Value)), keyby = .(month, hms)]
  
ggplot2::ggplot(plotDT, aes(x = hms , y = meanValue)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ month)
```

What is this? Is this even the right shape?? \@ref(fig:plotf1meanValueByTime) Could be... but the values are weird.

> It can't be voltage can it (with outliers)?
